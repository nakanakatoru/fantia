# Known Issues

## Forbidden characters in name on windows (resolved, with side effect)

On windows, there are some characters are forbidden in a file or directory name, so I replaced them into `+` character.

Following characters will be replaced into `+` character: `/`, `\`, `?`, `%`, `*`, `:`, `|`, `"`, `<`, `>`.
